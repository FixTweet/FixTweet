## Written in TypeScript as a Cloudflare Worker to scale, packed with more features and [best-in-class user privacy üîí](#built-with-privacy-in-mind).

### Add `fx` before your `twitter.com` link to make it `fxtwitter.com`, OR

### Change `x.com` to `fixupx.com` in your link

### For `twitter.com` links on Discord, send a link and type `s/e/p` to make `twittpr.com`.

## Embed Videos

We all have videos of memes and other things from Twitter we want to quickly share with friends. With normal Twitter links, embedding videos is often broken on Discord and impossible on Telegram. But using FixTweet, we embed the raw mp4 file so it's compatible with just about anything supporting video embeds.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165560751363325952/1006337645737156758/FixTweet.png)

On Discord, we'll also automatically embed videos linked from other platforms, such as YouTube, so they can play without having to open a browser.

## Embed Polls

If you want to share the results of a Twitter poll, you can do so by just linking the post using FixTweet.

## Embed Quotes & Media

Quotes and their media can provide important context to a post. So we'll automatically add said context, and even media if there isn't already media embedded in the quote.

## Translate Posts

You can translate a post into any other supported language, with the original and translated text displayed as space allows.

Just append a post with its 2-letter ISO language code. So for English, add `/en` at the end.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165560751363325952/1006333011136102400/FixTweet.png)

## Direct media links

Want to link directly to a post's media without the embed? You can easily do that using FixTweet.

![Image demonstrating the feature](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165560751363325952/1006338772192989194/FixTweet.png)

There are a few supported ways to do this:

- Add `d.` or `dl.` before the domain (so, `d.twittpr.com` or `dl.fxtwitter.com`)
- Add `.mp4` to the end of videos or `.jpg` to the end of images, after the post ID
- Add `/dl` or `/dir` between the domain and the username

Examples from above:

- `https://d.twittpr.com/dangeredwolf/status/1548119328498728960`
- `https://fxtwitter.com/dangeredwolf/status/1548117889437208581.jpg`
- `https://fxtwitter.com/dl/dangeredwolf/status/1548117889437208581`

Posts with multiple images are supported, so you can do something like this and it will pick the correct one:

`https://d.twittpr.com/dangeredwolf/status/1547514042146865153/photo/3`

Otherwise, it will default to the first image.

## Replace t.co shorteners with original link

The default Twitter embeds include t.co link shorteners, which make it difficult to know where the link is heading. We automatically replace t.co links with their original links to make things clearer.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165560751363325952/1006348698659344464/FixTweet.png)

## Redirect to Nitter or other custom instances

If you want to redirect to Nitter or another custom Twitter interface, you can set your custom redirect domain, like so: `https://fxtwitter.com/set_base_redirect?url=https://nitter.net`

At this time, the cookie is only set on the domain you set it on, so if you set it up using `fxtwitter.com`, `fixupx.com` will not redirect to your custom domain unless you set it there.

## Built with privacy in mind

FixTweet doesn't save logs of what posts you're sending, nor do we have a public record of what posts are being embedded by FixTweet.

In fact, because our core embedding and API service uses Cloudflare Workers, FixTweet can only run when you send it a request. Its memory doesn't stick around, and it doesn't have a file system or database to read from at all. That is how we keep our privacy promise by building it into the architecture. We use Cloudflare Analytics Engine to aggregate basic, anonymous statistics, which do not include information that could identify individual users or posts. My goal is always to provide a good public service, and FixTweet doesn't have any ads or tracking to make money off of, nor do we sell data.

Note: We use Cloudflare to cache FixTweet responses to make repeat access faster, which have a maximum TTL of 1 hour. Temporary real-time logging in the terminal (specifically `wrangler tail`) may be used only by the developer while the Worker is being serviced or debugged (to make sure things work as they should), however these logs are only shown in the terminal and are never saved or used for any other purpose. URLs that cause runtime errors in the script (aka Exceptions, usually exceedingly rare unless there was a faulty update pushed out or Twitter API is down) may be logged for a developer to diagnose the issue that is preventing your embed from working.

On a different note, if the person who posted a FixTweet link forgot to strip tracking parameters (like `?s` and `&t`), we strip it upon redirecting to the post as they are only used for Twitter telemetry and advertising.

## Why use FixTweet?

In many ways, FixTweet has richer embeds and does more. Here's a table comparing some of FixTweet's features compared to Twitter default embeds as well as other embedding services

¬π Discord will attempt to embed Twitter's video player, but it is unreliable and does not work on mobile

¬≤ Discord uses a custom embed container for Twitter.com to enable multi-image, which is unfortunately not available to other websites.

¬≥ On GitHub, BetterTwitFix (vxTwitter) claims to support this feature, however in my testing as of mid-July 2022, this does not seem to work.

‚Å¥ External media requiring web containers, such as YouTube, won't embed in Telegram because Telegram doesn't support it. Plain media will work in Telegram, and it works either way inside Discord.

## Why FixTweet is nicer to develop for and deploy

TwitFix and its derivatives have quite a few dependencies you need to rely on. You need to set up a server somewhere, install Python, all its dependencies, then either set up `youtube-dl` (more resource intensive) or beg Twitter for API access, and optionally set up a database, otherwise it uses the file system to cache.

FixTweet was written from the start as a lightweight, TypeScript-based Cloudflare Worker. Cloudflare Workers are completely free for up to 100,000 requests per day, per account. Cloudflare Workers are [fast to set up](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) and your script is distributed in their datacenters around the world for lower latency.

FixTweet does not need a database nor a Twitter API key: It takes a similar approach to `youtube-dl` where it pretends to be a logged-out Twitter web user, fetching a guest token and making API requests from there. As far as I can tell, this basically means we have "unlimited" read-only access to Twitter's API, including things they don't expose in their public API, useful for polls and other features.

## Deploy FixTweet yourself

Clone the repo, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and run `npm install` in the repo directory. Copy `wrangler.example.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and add your [Cloudflare account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/find-account-and-zone-ids/), and change the name of your worker if you need to. Also copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change HOST_URL, DIRECT_MEDIA_DOMAINS to your desired domain and whatever else you need to do. Authenticate with Cloudflare with `npx wrangler login`, then do `npm run deploy` (or `npx wrangler deploy --no-bundle`).

[If you have more questions about setting up Cloudflare Workers, check out their Getting Started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).

Once you're set up with your worker on `*.workers.dev`, [add your worker to your custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/routing/custom-domains/).

Populate Sentry details in your `.env` to use Sentry in your product to catch exceptions.

In 2023, Twitter began blocking posts with NSFW media from the guest API. We use a service binding code-named [elongator](https://github.com/FixTweet/elongator), which use empty Twitter accounts to make these requests successfully. This is an optional component and is only necessary for those who plan to support embedding NSFW media. This method also means you never have to pay Elon Musk to use Twitter's official API.

## Q&A

### What's the difference between `fxtwitter.com`, `twittpr.com`, and `pxtwitter.com`?

They all run the exact same worker and function identically... mostly.

`fxtwitter.com` is the primary domain these days, with `twittpr.com` as an alternative that allows for quick sed replacement. `pxtwitter.com` was our original domain, but we consider that to be deprecated now.

The way we handle this is that on post-deprecation posts linked using `pxtwitter.com`, instead of saying "FixTweet", it will have a notice that we've moved to `fxtwitter.com`. The embeds and redirects will still work, and posts posted before deprecation will not be unaffected at all, but it will gently encourage people to migrate by applying the notice to newer posts.

`pxtwitter.com` was our original domain for the project, bought the day before we launched FixTweet (then known as pxTwitter). I was trying to find something memorable and `px` kinda sounds like "pix" or can mean "pixels" which is fitting as a service that can embed images, videos, etc. Not long after, I bought `twittpr.com` because it's easier to do sed replacement with on Discord (`s/e/p`), and because it had a `p` in it, it was sorta related to pxTwitter. They have always functioned identically.

A couple weeks later, I acquired the `fxtwitter.com` domain from RobinUniverse and alongside this rebranded the project as FixTweet and shifted `fxtwitter.com` to be the primary domain instead of `pxtwitter.com`. Like the addition of `twittpr.com` this domain works identically to the others.

### How come embedding takes so long / is not working in Telegram?

Telegram's embedding servers sometimes never even send us a request to embed a URL, possibly due to their servers being overloaded. If you have a link that is broken you can try one of FixTweet's other domains (`fxtwitter.com`, `pxtwitter.com`, `twittpr.com`) or use [Webpage Bot](https://t.me/WebpageBot) to try to clear the cache of the embed.

### What if I don't want FixTweet to combine my post's images together with multi-image?

No problem! You can pick any specific photo from a post using Twitter's own URL syntax (`/photo/1` is the first photo of a post) and we'll render you the full-resolution original image.
